Past couple of years the sail has set <br/>
Again and again, but to never reach the goal <br/>
Sometimes the lack of focus, sometimes being a sloth, <br/>
But the repititive failures, shatter the soul <br/>
In this sea of simplistic chaos, where the chance <br/>
Of making it are infinitesimally low <br/>
My blue veins are now drained and my bright eyes <br/>
Are Starting to lose its glow <br/>
The glow that was determined to make it <br/>
On its very first try <br/>
And the mouth which used to pride my past, <br/> 
Can only let out of pityful cry <br/>
But now begins the chance to start yet again for the end <br/>
A chance to overturn the tide <br/>
The probabilities very much against me <br/>
But here comes my final stride <br/>
One last shot for me, the last one to secure <br/>
The better part of days that are yet to come. <br/>
Will my dreams finally spread its wings, <br/>
Or will they eventually burn.<br/>
