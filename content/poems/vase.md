The rough and gentle hands

That carve out a young vase

From the day that it was raw clay

To the day that the wheel falls silent.

It is ardous for the vase

To endure the grip of rough

Hands and the fiery flame.

But oh, how naive that soul is

For it does not know

A well baked vase is far more

Useful than a decorated one.
