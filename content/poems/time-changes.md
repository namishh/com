As I started cleaning<br/>
The small little room of mine<br/>
I found a large dusty box<br/>
Lit up by the sunshine<br/><br/>
I opened it and got struck<br/>
By overwhelming memories of the time<br/>
When I used to be fearless and brave<br/>
When I used to be in my prime<br/><br/>
It contained an old rusty sword<br/>
Which was used to be my best companion<br/>
Whose sharp and deadly metallic edge<br/>
Was enough to destroy the batallion<br/><br/>
The box had a golden telescope<br/>
Which still worked, to my awe<br/>
Its lens was of the finest quality<br/>
That made me capable of leading wars<br/><br/>
At last, I was unravelled the dress<br/>
A fine shirt, pant, hat and a coat<br/>
Which truly reminded me of who I was<br/>
The fearsome Pirate "Blackboat"<br/><br/>
I left that mantle years ago<br/>
And now I am not that fit<br/>
To bear the name once again<br/>
Of a person who wouldn't ever quit<br/>
