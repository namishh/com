The days are montonous<br/>
And everything feels the same <br/>
To the pitiful highschool kids <br/>
Who do not care much about fame <br/><br/>
These kids just want<br/>
Good marks in the test<br/>
Which will shape their life forever<br/>
Hopefully for the best<br/><br/>
By looking at these kids<br/>
You can just tell<br/>
That these aspirants are cut from the<br/>
The social life and are mentally unwell<br/><br/>
All the kids came with a hope<br/>
With their dreams high and afloat<br/>
But either they end up ending themselves<br/>
Or become just another robot
