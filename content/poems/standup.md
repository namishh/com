Whenever you feel like life has surrounded has you with problems <br/>
Whenever you are in a mess <br/>
Whenever you feel your situation <br/>
Cannot be more helpless <br/><br/>
Stand Up! And be courageous<br/>
And let your fears fade<br/>
You will see in the long run<br/>
The changes your decision has made.<br/><br/>
