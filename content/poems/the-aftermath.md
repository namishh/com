Lies a land in full turmoil

Broken buildings and uprooted soil

The same land which was once home

To multiple homes and families,

Now lays full of injured corpses

Due to war and its brutalities.

Rubble and dirt everywhere the eye can see,

Barren and cracked earth, where there were once trees.

Broken bonds and families torn apart,

A view so horrendous, the devil's art.

In the eyes of the young, a glimpse of fear,

Mothers unconsolable, with hearts full of tears.

All the misery, the pain, the strife 

Could never start with love and life

Only if we embraced the power we hold

To create a world where peace unfolds
