Happiness is not about getting rich<br/>
Happiness is not a feeling which<br/>
Can be obtained by being on the peak<br/>
It is something we have to seek<br/><br/>
Happiness is what we feel <br/>
When we throw away our ego and make it kneel<br/>
Something we get after destroying our greed<br/>
And helping those who are in need<br/>
