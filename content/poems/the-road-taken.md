Standing quietly, at the junction of fate,

Two paths diverging, a decision awaits.

The left one is well worn, thousands of footsteps ingrained.

A path so popular, yet tough to sustain.

The road on the right, a less trodden lane,

A newer location, A newer terrain.

But I felt the pressure, the weight of the crowd,

And down the first road, I was pushed and bowed.

Initial steps were comfortable, easy to embrace,

Yet I always speculated about the less taken space.

Always nagged a thought, a feeling unaligned,

About the road less taken that I left behind.

Many chances came by, to turn away,

Signposts of change, pointing towards a different way.

But the fear of being an outcast, made me leave my wish behind.

The fun and joy of the right road, now just echos in my mind.

The river of time flowed, and now no turning back I found.

In my ears ring, an omnious sound.

The whispers of regret, but now too deep in the tide.

Now very helpless, nothing I can decide.

In the silence of the night, I still dream about that choice,

The freedom, the thrill of an unexplored voice.

Ruined by a decision, now too far from the start.

I walk down the familiar road, with a heavy heart.
