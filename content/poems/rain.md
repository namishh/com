The sound of the rain<br/>
Of each of its tiny drop<br/>
It is so relaxing to <br/>
Listen to it nonstop <br/><br/>
A lifeline for the man<br/>
Who works in the rigourously in the soil<br/>
Who provides us with the grain<br/>
But can also be his turmoil<br/><br/>
If it not stops pouring<br/>
It can destroy the yields<br/>
And totally make worthless<br/>
The time spent in the fields<br/><br/>
But it also brings down the heat<br/>
And makes the surroundings tranquil<br/>
Motivates the demotivated<br/>
And fills them with an immense will <br/><br/>
Even though it can be the cause<br/>
Of destruction and havoc<br/>
Wipe out hundreds of beings<br/>
And decimate buildings from their framework<br/><br/>
Is rain benifical or not<br/>
Well the answer is not known by me<br/>
I think the answer ranges from person to person<br/>
Peaceful for some and for some deadly.
