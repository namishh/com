If the moments of joy and beauty

Were streched to an eternity

Would their "eternal" lustre slowly fade

And lose the spark, they once had made?
<br/>


Like a rose with it's beauty divine

A color so deep, like an aged wine

Would we still fall down to our knees

If its beauty lasted for an eternity?
<br/>

It took months of to and fro

And ardous work, for the rose to grow

Would it still make our minds enthrall

If it did not take any labour at all?
<br/>


The garderner who took utmost care

Perfecting a rose, for us to stare

Would we smile at the rose everyday

If there existed an easier way?
<br/>


Soon, autumn's entry will be made

The petals will fall and colors fade

Would we still think of the beauty of the rose

If it existed as long as time goes?
