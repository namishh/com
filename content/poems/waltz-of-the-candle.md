In a small village far away,

A lone candle puts quite a display.

The flame dancing with the evening air,

A tender waltz, spreading warmth everywhere.

The air warns the candle that its end is near,

Challenging the candle, but it shows no fear.

Flickering, trembling, on the verge it sways,

A story of resilience, unfold its ways.

The winds blow and the gusts assail,

But the flame endures determined to prevail.

Running out of breath, the wind so cold,

But refuses to die, a spirit so bold.

Surrendering, the breeze concedes its chase,

No longer disturbing the tranquil place.

And in the midnight hour, when shadows loom,

A candle burns bright, despite the nightly gloom.
