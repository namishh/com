In the palace of marble white <br>
He performs the holy rites <br>
Kneeling in front of the gods to bless his name <br>
In the incense smoke and the bright flame <br><br>
A choir of priests sing hymns of praise <br>
Of gods that created the earth the the sky <br>
The king moves his gaze towards the heaven <br>
In hopes his reign, they will sanctify <br><br>
While he prays, the subject weep <br>
Homes in ruins, no grain to eat <br>
The earth lies barren, the seeds they sow <br>
Bear no fruit and barely even grow <br><br>
The people protest to ears that are deaf <br>
They bear the burden of his fame <br>
While he in his comfort, seeks to find <br>
Eternal glory for his name <br><br>
His unecessary expeditions and wars <br>
The countless young men that died <br>
Yet in the hall, he declares it as just <br>
And still wants his reign to be sanctified <br><br>
Far better is a godless man <br>
Who lives by ethics and not by creed <br>
Than the ruthless fanatic who <br>
Shows his faith by violence and greed <br>
For a skeptic man all alone <br>
Outshines the tyrant on his throne <br>
