I remember the train, but <br>
I have long forgotten the station <br>
It used to travel to. <br>
What stayed with me <br>
Were the faces in the aisle <br>
Once strangers, turned friends <br>
The laughs and stories shared <br>
And seldom the wisdom of the gray framed <br>
That happened to sit by. <br>
In the rush of the morn <br>
And the spark of the dusk, <br>
The train just carried me <br>
But it was the company <br>
That made the journey <br>
Worth moving through.
