His shop is hollow, barren of light,<br/>
The clockmaker lost in the void in his head.<br/>
He wonders if he had chosen a different route,<br/>
A life not dictated by other's demands.<br/>
A dream of being in the king's royal army,<br/>
Marching in battles, fighting with might,<br/>
Feasting with fellow soldiers while laughing heartily<br/>
And retiring to live a plump old life.<br/>
Instead he spent most of his own life<br/>
Mending clocks of all sort<br/>
Never earning enough, always falling short,<br/> 
Stuck in a life he never sought,<br/>
Wishing he had dared to follow the different route.<br/>
In the quiet hours of soltitude <br/>
When the last customer walks away <br/>
He gets lost in his thoughts yet again <br/>
While the clocks on his walls tick away. <br/>
