So I know the left guy in the above image makes you feel that he is already a prodigy or a gifted _10x_ dev. But no he is not, he might be even programming less than the guy beside him but in the end, he is more productive.

Hi, been a while since I have written stuff in here. This post is about a change in my approach towards programming. I have been programming since I was 10, and I am few weeks away from turning 17 now. So yea, I have some "experience" in programming. My first two years in programming was just me making very simple apps and not thinking much about programming. I made very simple and random things like random number guesser, rock paper scissors, and the hardest thing I did was creating a weather app. I did not get that much serious about programmimng till the pandemic hit in early 2020.

## Getting Serious About It

Four years ago, when I meant getting better at programming, I meant getting stuck in a tremendous [tutorial hell](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/escape-tutorial-purgatory/). It was a very grim time, I will admit, as all I was doing was prgramming non sense projects from youtube but then not being able to do it myself, this repeated for a very extended period of time, a period of time that was way longer than I would like to admit. I was not becoming the next big _MERN stack guru_ by watching yet another [programming roadmap to 50lpa](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=programming+roadmap+mern). I was under this facade of confidence which was being crushed the moment I stepped out on the field, on my own. I was only getting good at following, not creating. It was a constant oscillation between the "Mount Stupid" and the "Valley of Despair".

In 2021 and 2022, while still doing React, I was able to slowly create things on my own and started to finally settle in as a frontend dude. But of course, I was getting bored, and in March of 2022, as I was losing interest in computers as a whole, I discovered

## Linux and School

In 2022, I discovered [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and I felt my interest for computers reignite and burn brighter than ever. As I was a frontend dev, I quickly got into [ricing](/blog/ricing) and got again into python for making scripts, C for customizing [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) and Lua for customizing [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org). This made me get into computers back, the entirety of 2022 was spent doing wacky stuff with the display of my arch install, I broke it multiple times, I fixed it, sometimes had to reinstall it, but I was having fun.

In 2023, I made maybe one of the best gambits ever, I changed my school and the exposure to tech I got there was immense. I was the part of the school club, and the people I met through my school's compeition (like [ni5arga](https://github.com/ni5arga)\) was amazing and only boosted my morale to get better in tech and get me into a programming spree sort of. But there was an obstacle, JEE.

Due to JEE which is in 2025, I was not able to give much time to programming as JEE is a higher priorty task than programming, the time I got was not enough to _master_ something but then I found myself in a zone way better.

## It Should Be Fun

From 2024, I have only created project thats I myself find interesting to make, like [text editor](https://github.com/namishh/pound), url shorterners from [complete scratch](https://github.com/namishh/shawty) in C and htmx, [neural networks](https://github.com/namishh/neuing) or sometimes even small little utilities such as [palette generator](https://github.com/namishh/venusta). All of these projects are made with no external dependencies (subtle small flex). Right now I am working on [biotrack](https://git.new/biotrack).

I am now just programming for fun. I just think of a project, pick a random language and start coding in it. I may not understand the language (like Rust), but it is a new challenge for me that I am willing to take. But programming experience peaked for me when I started to program in

C geniunely made me love programming. The amount of things you can do with such a minimal feature set is mindblowing. This is what I thought Rust was bad at, keeping it simple. There are so many inbuilt things in Rust, it is very hard for me feeble brain to comprehend. But I guess that is what you get, in exchange of a truly memory safe language. I made a [password game discord bot](https://github.com/namishh/scuffword) as my first project to C and I was blown away with its simplicity, which led to me to make this meme

Right now, I am way beyond the Valley Of Despair, I am not a prodigy, I am not a 10x dev, I am not a _MERN stack guru_, I am just a guy who likes to program. Honestly, I would be on the middle of slope of englightenment, I am not a master of anything, I am not a beginner of anything, I am just a guy who likes to program. I am not a tryhard, I am an enjoyer.


Update, The Primeagen, posted this on twitter, and I think it is very relevant to this post
